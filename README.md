Custom Web Browser
A foundational web browser built from scratch in C++ without using existing engines like Chromium, Gecko, or WebKit. The project follows a modular, privacy-focused architecture, with long-term plans that include networking, HTML parsing, rendering, JavaScript execution, multimedia, and advanced security.

Project Overview
This project is intended as a learning journey to understand how browsers work at a low level. Each phase adds another layer of functionality and complexity.

Key features (planned and partially implemented) include:

Networking (HTTP/HTTPS)

Socket-based HTTP/HTTPS using OpenSSL for secure connections.

Certificate validation and optional forced HTTPS.

HTML Parsing & DOM Construction

Building a DOM tree from raw HTML data.

Rendering Engine

Lays out DOM elements and handles drawing (future phase).

JavaScript Execution

Interpretation of JS to manipulate the DOM (future phase).

Multimedia Playback

Handling of audio/video elements (future phase).

Security & Cookie Management

Managing cookies, certificate checks, and potential tracking protection.

Phases Completed
Phase 1: Initial Setup & Build System Configuration
CMake configured.

Verified tooling (Git, g++, CMake).

Basic project structure in place.

Simple message output:

Custom Web Browser Starting...
Phase 2: Architectural Design & Core Modules
Created a modular structure with header files for each major subsystem:

Networking (HttpClient)

HTML Parser (HtmlParser)

Renderer (Renderer)

JavaScript Engine (JavaScriptEngine)

Multimedia (MediaPlayer)

Security & Privacy (SecurityManager)

No functionality yet—just class definitions and architecture planning.

Phase 3: Networking (HTTP + HTTPS)
Implemented socket-based HTTP (plain TCP).

HTTPS (TLS) using OpenSSL:

SSL handshake (using SSL_connect).

Certificate verification with a CA bundle.

Forced HTTPS for non-localhost URLs.

Returns raw HTML (including partial chunked encoding for now).

Example Output: When fetching a page, you may see chunked metadata like:

php-template
Copy
Edit
37ae
<!doctype html><html ...> ...
This is expected at this stage. We haven’t fully implemented chunked decoding yet.

Future Phases & Planned Features
Phase 4: HTML Parsing & DOM Construction
Lexer/Parser for HTML5

DOM Tree in memory

Phase 5: CSS & Rendering Engine
CSS parsing (box model, flexbox, etc.)

Layout & painting (2D drawing)

Phase 6: JavaScript Execution
Integrate a JS interpreter or minimal engine like Duktape

DOM manipulation (e.g., document.createElement, event listeners)

Phase 7: Multimedia (Images & Videos)
Image decoding (PNG, JPEG)

Audio/Video playback

Security & Cookie Enhancements
Cookie management (first-party vs. third-party)

Tracking protection (blocking known trackers)

Advanced TLS checks (SNI, HSTS, certificate pinning)

Performance & Memory Optimizations
Caching & concurrency

Partial rendering for large pages

Minimizing memory usage
