Custom Web Browser (C++ Project)
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This is a foundational web browser built from scratch using C++ without leveraging existing engines like Chromium, Gecko, or WebKit. The goal is to develop a modular, privacy-focused browser featuring:

Networking (HTTP/HTTPS)
HTML Parsing â†’ DOM Construction
Rendering Engine
JavaScript Execution
Multimedia Playback
Advanced Security & Cookie Management
This repository is a long-term learning project, following a structured phase-based approach.

ðŸš€ Phase 2: Architectural Design & Core Modules
In this phase, we designed our browserâ€™s modular architecture but did not implement the functionality yet. We created header files for each major subsystem:

Networking (HttpClient)

Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests
Opens sockets, fetches raw HTML data
HTML Parser (HtmlParser)

Converts raw HTML strings into a DOM tree structure
Renderer (Renderer)

Lays out and draws the DOM tree visually (in later phases)
JavaScript Engine (JavaScriptEngine)

Interprets JS code and manipulates the DOM
Multimedia (MediaPlayer)

Plays video and audio elements
Security & Privacy (SecurityManager)

Manages cookies, blocks malicious scripts
Outcome: We ended Phase 2 with C++ class definitions (.h files) but no real code. This step clarified where each piece of the browser logic would eventually live.

ðŸš€ Phase 3: Networking (HTTP + HTTPS)
1. Plain HTTP Fetch
We implemented a basic socket-based client that:
Resolves domain names (DNS) using getaddrinfo
Connects via TCP (socket, connect)
Sends an HTTP request
Receives the raw HTML content
2. HTTPS (TLS) Integration
Leveraged OpenSSL to handle TLS encryption and certificate verification:
SSL handshake (using SSL_connect)
Encrypted reads/writes (SSL_read, SSL_write)
Certificate checks against a trusted CA bundle (e.g., ca-certificates.crt)
3. Forced HTTPS Except Localhost
If the host is not localhost or 127.0.0.1, our browser automatically upgrades to port 443 (HTTPS).
We still allow HTTP for localhost dev servers.
4. Certificate Validation
We load a CA file (.pem or .crt) to verify server certificates.
If the certificate is invalid or self-signed, the client logs a warning (in a real browser, weâ€™d block or alert users).
5. Current Behavior
We do not fully parse chunked transfers yet, so you may see chunk-size metadata in the raw HTML.
We return the raw HTML as a std::string, which can be printed to the console for debugging.
6. Typical Output Example
When fetching https://www.google.com, you might see raw HTML plus partial chunk encodings:

php-template
Copy
Edit
37ae
<!doctype html><html ...>
...
Thatâ€™s expectedâ€”the networking layer is working. Weâ€™ll handle chunked encoding in a future phase.

Phases Completed So Far
Phase 1: Project Setup

CMake build system, initial project structure, Git repo.
Phase 2: Architecture Design

Header files for Networking, Parsing, Rendering, JS, Multimedia, Security.
Modular approach ensures each subsystem is independent.
Phase 3: Networking (HTTP/HTTPS)

Implemented HttpClient to fetch pages over plain TCP or TLS (using OpenSSL).
Enforces HTTPS for external sites, allows HTTP for localhost.
You can now retrieve raw HTML content from websites securely.

ðŸ”® Future Phases & Planned Features
Phase 4: HTML Parsing & DOM Construction

Implement a lexer/parser for HTML5.
Build a DOM tree in memory.
Phase 5: CSS & Rendering Engine

Parse CSS and apply styles (box model, flexbox, etc.).
Layout & paint the DOM visually (2D drawing).
Phase 6: JavaScript Execution

Integrate a basic JS interpreter or use a minimal engine (like Duktape).
Enable DOM manipulation (e.g., document.createElement, event listeners).
Phase 7: Multimedia (Images & Videos)

Decode images (PNG/JPEG).
Support <video> playback (possibly using a third-party library like FFmpeg).
Phase 8: Privacy & Security

Cookie Management: First-party vs. third-party cookies.
Tracking Protection: Possibly block known tracking domains.
Advanced TLS checks: SNI, HSTS, certificate pinning.
Performance & Memory Optimizations

Minimizing memory usage (vs. multi-process browsers).
Partial rendering, caching, concurrency, etc.
